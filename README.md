## Inspiration
Wanted to demonstrate a Near  Network powered Smart Crypto Portfolio Management System (Smartfolio). Have refined the overall strategy by developing an adaptive solution that's simple to adopt and use. Focus is to build an actively managed portfolio that combines management expertise, innovative technology and most importantly high efficiency. costs

## What it does
Powered by Near, Smartfolio is a automated portfolio manager, liquidity provider, and price sensor that enables decentralized trading and automatic portfolio management of tokens on the Near blockchain. Users can verify market price, confidence score, and valid slot of various crypto pairs with the aid of Smartfolio, and develop a portfolio for any crypto pair based on that with the use of the smart threshold parameter. This smart threshold will be configurable by the user. For example, if the smart threshold is set to 5%, then our portfolio's crypto pair is sold or bought if the price falls below or equals 5%.

## How we built it
Platform currently comprises a website and server backend. The website is built through a combination of QuickBase (which is a Low Code No Code platform), NodeJS, Near NodeJS SDK.

## Challenges we ran into
Had some trouble understanding out how to use APIs when building our website, as well as a few visualization concerns. The most difficult part of the backend server was figuring out how to perform API queries because we had little to no expertise with the sponsor's JS SDKs.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Excited to be a part of a changing world that is advancing technology to improve people's lives today and in the future.

## What we learned
Learned about a variety of technologies, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of current technology, and how blockchain and decentralized internet might assist to solve such disadvantages. Near, Smart Contracts, NFTs and Web3 are some of the new technologies we've learned about.

## What's next for Smartfolio
Smartfolio will continue to evolve by adding new features and working with a variety of financial technology service providers.
